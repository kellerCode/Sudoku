# Sudoku

This is Version 2 of a sudoku game I made.
I am using C# for all of the logic
The user fills in the puzzle and sumbits a form.
The form is submitted using Ajax, this way it will hold all of the values and not refresh the page.
Then all of the values are checked in the controller and a message of either try again or good job. 

There are different options for either a blank grid or one with starting numbers. There are 3 different difficulty options and are using a random selector of a list of arrays. 

These arrays are hard coded at the moment. 
I am currently working on Creating my own starting arrays that would have one unique answer. 

Here's a link to the game.
