# Sudoku

This is Version 1 of a sudoku game I made.
I am using C# for all of the logic
The user fills in the puzzle and sumbits a form.
The form is submitted using Ajax, this way it will hold all of the values and not refresh the page.
Then all of the values are checked in the controller and a message of either try again or good job.
